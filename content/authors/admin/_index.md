I am a final-year PhD student in Data Science/Precision Medicine at The University of Edinburgh. I studied *Statistics* at the Athens University of Economics and Business (2017), and completed an MSc in **Medical Statistics** at the University of Southampton (2018). I have previously worked as a Data Analyst at PREDICTA S.A. (former SPSS BI GREECE S.A.).  

My research interests are machine learning, deep learning, medical statistics, cardiology and R Shiny app development as clinical decision support tool.
