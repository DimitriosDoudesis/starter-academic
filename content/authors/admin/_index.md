I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Lecturer of the Health Data Science course at The University of Edinburgh, where I specialize in **Data Science** and **Precision Medicine**. I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Statistics** from The Athens University of Economics and Business (2017) and a Master's degree in **Medical Statistics** from The University of Southampton (2018). In 2022, I completed my PhD in **Data Science** at The University of Edinburgh.

Prior to this, I worked as a Data Analyst at PREDICTA S.A. (formerly SPSS BI GREECE S.A.). My research interests lie in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, medical statistics, cardiology, and the development of R Shiny apps as clinical decision-support tools.
